  This is a description of my website. Descriptions are so informative, I have no idea what we did without them.
  Regardless, William's website is probably going to be used for self-promotion and all that good stuff.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://williamwallace.co.nz" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
